**About**

After following Andrej Karpathy's walkthrough on building Micrograd, I created my own version of this fully-connected model. Since this is an inference project, the main project file is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). This project is not intended for commercial use and is only for my personal use and/or learning purposes.
